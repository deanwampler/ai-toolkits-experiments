# README for `ollama`

Experiments with the very useful `ollama` system for running inference locally.

* `models-install.sh`: Install a lot of local models. Edit the list of models to taste!
* `experiments/quantize.py`: Unfinished code for configuring how quantization of models is done (TODO).
* `experiments/question.txt`: Miscellaneous queries I used for testing.
