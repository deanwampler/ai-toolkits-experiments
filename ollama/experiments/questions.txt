There is a bug in the following function. What is it? 
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

There is a bug in the following function. What is it? 
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [-1, 0]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence
