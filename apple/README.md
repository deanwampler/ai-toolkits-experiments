# README for apple

First, set up a Python environment with `venv` or `conda`, if you want to keep things separated. (You may even want separate environments for the following projects.)

Projects:

## `ml-aim`

Experiment with the `ml-aim` library for _AIM: Autoregressive Image Models_, [Scalable Pre-training of Large Autoregressive Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08541).

Uses submodule [`ml-aim`](https://github.com/apple/ml-aim).

## `axlearn`

_AXLearn_ is a library built by Apple on top of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) to support the development of large-scale deep learning models.

Uses submodule [`axlearn`](https://github.com/apple/axlearn).

## `mlx-lm`

Exploring Apple's MLX deep learning framework.

The [`mlx-deep-dive`](https://github.com/apple/mlx-deep-dive) submodule is the git repo for [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-llms-locally-with-apples-mlx-framework-2b3862049a93).


## `mlx-examples`

Apple's MLX examples. The submodule [`mlx-examples`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples).
